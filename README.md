# ACF_ALS_Integration
This Integration is built using Doga's ALS V4 c++ port. i do not take any credit for the port i just modified very little code but mostly animBP to work in tandem with ACF Plugin.
This Integration does not have the latest changes done to the c++ port. Uses tag 4.18.
This Video explains the set up steps.

however in ACF 2.0 you will still get errors from functions that use the deleted data you can delete or comment those functions too.

Given i am the only person that worked on this and i am unable to maintain it and answer all question about it on my own, you are free to do what you like with it.
Join the Discord if you have any questions i will answer to the best of my ability (PLEASE DO NOT EXPECT ANY KIND OF SUPPORT THERE'S NONE).
